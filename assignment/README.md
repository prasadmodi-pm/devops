Continuous Integration is Setup in Circle CI, file is in devops/.circleci/config.yml

Circle CI is triggered when I push my code changes to my feature branch and also when I merge my PR to master.

CircleCI dashboard to login requires my username and password (for viewing build pass/ fail pipeline). While giving demo I can show by login.
